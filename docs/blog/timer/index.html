<h2 id="timer">Timer</h2>
<p>I want to create timer interrupts. To test that I will write a small program to print a sentence every 5 seconds.
From the <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-aclint/blob/main/riscv-aclint.adoc">RISCV ACLINT Specification</a> I know that there is a timer device called MTIMER with one <em>mtime</em> register that counts up with fixed frequnecy. Additionally, MTIMER has <em>mtimecmp</em> registers (one per HART) to set the timer. The value in <em>mtime</em> is always compared to the <em>mtimecmp</em> regoster of the HART - if it is the same or greater, a timer interrupt is triggered. For signalling an interrupt, we have the <em>mip</em> register.</p>
<p>As for now: the specification says <em>mtime</em> and <em>mtimecmp</em> have different base addresses and I don't know yet where that is because it depends on the architecture so now I go through the code of virt to find it.</p>
