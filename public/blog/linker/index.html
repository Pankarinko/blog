<p>I set out to write a simple operating system for RISCV just for fun. This blog describes all the steps (and missteps) I took</p>
<h2 id="how-i-got-started">How I got started</h2>
<p>Since I only came up with the idea of this blog after I already did some things - mainly to motivate myself - I will try to remember and summarize what I did.</p>
<h3 id="linker-script">Linker Script</h3>
<p>This was the first and unfortunately most fucked up part of the whole thing so far. Here is the code I have so far in the <em>script.ld</em> file:</p>
<pre data-lang="css" style="background-color:#282a36;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-css "><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span>ENTRY(asm_entry)
</span><span>OUTPUT_ARCH(riscv)
</span><span>
</span><span>MEMORY {
</span><span>
</span><span>    RAM (rwx) : org = </span><span style="color:#bd93f9;">0</span><span>x</span><span style="color:#bd93f9;">80000000</span><span>, len = </span><span style="color:#bd93f9;">1</span><span>M
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>PHDRS {
</span><span>  text PT_LOAD;
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>SECTIONS {
</span><span> .text : {
</span><span>    . = ALIGN(</span><span style="color:#bd93f9;">8</span><span>);
</span><span>    PROVIDE(startkernel = .);
</span><span>    *(.text)
</span><span>    *(.text*)
</span><span>    PROVIDE(endkernel = .);
</span><span> } &gt; RAM : </span><span style="color:#ff79c6;">text
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<h4 id="now-the-explanation">Now the explanation:</h4>
<p>The first line tells the linker that the code starts at the label <em>asm_entry (found in entry.S)</em>
The second line the architecture to RISCV.</p>
<p>In the <strong>MEMORY</strong> section, I define all addressess above 0x80000000 as RAM. This is the address from which the RISCV architecture allows the OS and user space programs to use memory - everything smaller than this address is mapped to some device. My RAM is readable, writable and executable (rwx) however at this point I know I will probably need to define a new memory section that is not writable for the kernel, because kernel code shouldn't reside in writable memory.</p>
<p><strong>PHDRS</strong> defines ELF program headers <em>(see also <a href="https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/ld-2.9.1/html_node/ld_23.html">here</a></em>. I only have one memory segment so far, <em>.text</em>. <em>PT_LOAD</em> means, that this segment has to be loaded from a file.</p>
<p>The <strong>SECTIONS</strong> part describes all the segments our memory will have. Again, at this point I only have some kernel code so I only have the <em>.text</em> segment, where the kernel code is.  The address of the beginning of this segment is saved into the variable <em>startkernel</em>, the address of the end is saved into the variable <em>endkernel</em>. These variables will be used in the C-code later. The segment is aligned by 8 Bytes because I write this OS for RISCV64. <em>.text</em> will be placed in the RAM memory section.</p>
